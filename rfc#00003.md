## Summary

Trust domains are a key concept within Enarx.  This RFC provides an
introduction to trust domains in Enarx.

## Motivation

This RFC takes the introduction around trust domains in RFC#00002, and
applies it to Enarx.

## Tutorial

See RFC#00002 for an introduction to trust domains.

### Applying trust relationships to Enarx
The key trust relationship for Enarx is that held by the tenant
(workload owner) to the workload it owns.  Enarx aims to provide
assurances to the tenant that the integrity and confidentiality of
that workload are protected: these are the key contexts of that trust,
and actions can be assured if they are maintained.  Trust in the workload
may decay or be built up - the time context.  In this case, the workload
does not have an equivalent set of assurances about the tenant, so the
relationship is not symmetrical.

See RFC#00002 for an introduction to trust relationships.

### Applying trust domains to Enarx - default model
There are various possible models for trust domains in an Enarx
deployment - this section describes the simplest, and default model.
In the default Enarx model, we start off by defining the following parties
- tenant
- host owner (the host operator may be separate, but is considered to
be the same for this description)
- entities running processes on the host (includes other workloads
and compromised processes)
- man-in-the-middle entities
Clearly, the first two are the key actors - the others are included for
reference (no threat model is defined here).

The following components are defined:
- host - the machine running workloads, including all hardware, firmware
and software which is not specifically a workload
- host CPU + CPU firmware (a subset of the host)
- Orchestrator (e.g. Kubernetes, Openshift, Openstack)
- tenant workload image
- tenant workload image repository
- Enarx client agent (ECA)
- Enarx host agent (EHA)
- Enarx runtime image
- TEE instance
- Empty Keep
- Provisioned Keep
- tenant workload
- Other workloads
Not all of these exist at all points in the process.


### Non-Enarx-enabled use case states
In the non-TEE-assisted case, all processes running on the host are in
the host's trust domain (this assumes no compromised processes - if
there were any compromised processes, these would be in another, also
untrusted domain).  We ignore man-in-the-middle entities.  For the
default trust domain model, we assume that the Orchestrator is
operated by the tenant and that the tenant workload image repository
is also operated by the tenant.

#### State 0 non-Enarx-enabled use case (initial)
No Enarx-related components are relevant to this use case.
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - tenant workload image
  - tenant workload image repository

Note - there are models where a trust relationship is maintained by
the tenant to the tenant workload image repository or to the tenant
workload, but it is not directly within the trust domain.  These
models are not examined in this document.

#### State 1 non-Enarx-enabled use case (provisioned)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - tenant workload
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - tenant workload image
  - tenant workload image repository
  
The change from state `0` to `1` is the provisioning of the tenant workload
onto the host from the tenant workload image.

The key point of this use case from a trust domain point of view it that
since the host has access to all processes and associated memory that are
running on it, all workloads that run on the host can only exist within
the host trust domain.

### Enarx use case states
Note: that exact state details may vary by implementation.

#### State 0 Enarx use case (initial state)
Initial state (we assume no compromised processes on host):
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - Enarx runtime image
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - tenant workload image
  - tenant workload image repository
  
This is the same as the initial state for the non-Enarx-enabled
use case, but with the Enarx components added here.

#### State 1 Enarx use case (TODO: check name - pre-attestation)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - TEE instance
  - Enarx runtime instance (within TEE instance)
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - tenant workload image
  - tenant workload image repository
  
The state change from `0` to `1` creates a TEE instance and loads
the Enarx runtime image into it, running it to create an Enarx
runtime instance.

#### State 2 Enarx use case (TODO: check name - attested)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - Empty Keep
  - tenant workload image
  - tenant workload image repository
  
The state change from `1` to `2` moves the Empty Keep into the tenant
trust domain.  The TEE instance has transformed into a Keep as
it has been loaded with the Enarx runtime and attested.

#### State 3 Enarx use case (TODO: check name - provisioned)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - Provisioned Keep
  - tenant workload image
  - tenant workload image repository
  
The state change from `2` to `3` provisions the tenant workload into
the (previously empty) Keep.


### Applications and trust domains in Enarx
It may be that the tenant workload, once running, should not
continue to exist in the top-level tenant trust domain, but may
be moved into a sub-domain, or even transferred to another owner or
tenant.  Such chances are application-level: the key aim of Enarx,
from a trust domain point of view, is to allow the provisioning of
workloads by a tenant into their own trust domain, rather than the
host trust domain.

## Future Possibilities

- Threat models should be documented and published as RFCs [Issue 15](https://github.com/enarx/rfcx/issues/15)
- Status of hardware/firmware in trust relationships in Enarx
needs to be documented [Issue #10](https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/issues/10)
- Further trust models could be defined beyond the default one presented here.
