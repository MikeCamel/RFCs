## Summary

Trust domains are a key concept within Enarx.  This RFC provides an
introduction to trust domains in Enarx.

## Motivation

This RFC takes the introduction around trust domains in RFC#00002, and
applies it to Enarx.

## Tutorial

See rfc#00002 for an introduction to trust relationships.

### Applying trust relationships to Enarx
The key trust relationship for Enarx is that held by the tenant
(workload owner) to that workload.  Enarx aims to provide assurances to
the tenant that the integrity and confidentiality of that workload are
protected: these are the key contexts of that trust, and actions can be
assured if they are maintained.  Trust may decay or be built up in the
workload - the time context.  In this case, the workload does not have an
equivalent set of assurances about the tenant, so the relationship is
not symmetrical.

See rfc#00002 for an introduction to trust relationships.

### Applying trust domains to Enarx - default model
There are various possible models for trust domains in an Enarx
deployment - this section describes the simplest, and default model.
In the default Enarx model, we start off by defining the following parties
- tenant
- host owner (the host operator may be separate, but is considered to
be the same for this description)
- entities running processes on the host (includes other workloads
and compromised processes)
- man-in-the-middle entities
Clearly, the first two are the key actors - the others are included for
reference (no threat model is defined here).

The following components are defined:
- host 
- host CPU + CPU firmware
- Orchestrator (e.g. Kubernetes, Openshift, Openstack)
- Tenant workload image
- Tenant workload image repository
- Enarx client agent (ECA)
- Enarx host agent (EHA)
- Enarx runtime image
- TEE instance
- Empty Keep
- Provisioned Keep
- Tenant workload
- Other workloads
Not all of these exist at all points in the process.


### Non-Enarx-enabled use case states
In the non-TEE-assisted case, all processes running on the host are in
the host's trust domain (this assumes no compromised processes).  We
ignore man-in-the-middle entities.  For the default trust domain model,
we assume that the Orchestrator is operated by the tenant and that the
Tenant workload image repository is also operated by the tenant.

#### State 0 non-Enarx-enabled use case (initial)
No Enarx-related components are relevant to this use case.
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Tenant workload image
  - Tenant workload image repository

Note - there are models where a trust relationship is maintained by
the tenant to the Tenant workload image repository or to the tenant
workload, but it is not directly within the trust domain.  These
models are not examined in this document.

#### State 1 non-Enarx-enabled use case (provisioned)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Tenant workload
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Tenant workload image
  - Tenant workload image repository
The change from state 0 to 1 is the provisioning of the Tenant workload
onto the host from the Tenant workload image.

The key point of this use case from a trust domain point of view it that
since the host has access to all processes and associated memory that are
running on it, all workloads that run on the host can only exist within
the host trust domain.

### Enarx use case states
Note that exact state details may vary by implementation.

#### State 0 Enarx use case (initial state)
Initial state (we assume no compromised processes on host):
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - Enarx runtime image
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - Tenant workload image
  - Tenant workload image repository
This is the same as the initial state for the non-Enarx-enabled
use case, with the exception of the Enarx components.

#### State 1 Enarx use case (TODO: check name - pre-attestation)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - TEE instance
  - Enarx runtime image (within TEE instance)
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - Tenant workload image
  - Tenant workload image repository
The state change from 0 to one creates a TEE instance and loads
the Enarx runtime image into it.  

#### State 2 Enarx use case (TODO: check name - attested)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - Empty Keep
  - Tenant workload image
  - Tenant workload image repository
The state change from 1 to 2 moves the Empty Keep into the tenant
trust domain.  The TEE instance has transformed into a Keep as
it has been loaded with the Enarx runtime agent and attested.

#### State 3 Enarx use case (TODO: check name - provisioned)
- host owner trust domain
  - host
  - host CPU + CPU firmware
  - Enarx host agent
  - Other workloads
- tenant trust domain
  - Orchestrator
  - Enarx client agent
  - Provisioned Keep
  - Tenant workload image
  - Tenant workload image repository
The state change from 2 to 3 provisions the tenant workload into
the (previously empty) Keep.


### Applications and trust domains in Enarx
It may be that the tenant workload, once running, should not
continue to exist in the top-level tenant trust domain, but may
be moved into a sub-domain, or even transferred to another owner or
tenant.  Such chances are application-level: the key aim of Enarx,
from a trust domain point of view, is to allow the provisioning of
workloads by a tenant into their own trust domain, rather than the
host trust domain.

## Future Possibilities

- Threat models should be documented and published as RFCs (Issue #240)[https://github.com/enarx/enarx/issues/240]
- Status of hardware/firmware in trust relationships in Enarx
needs to be documented (Issue #193)[https://github.com/enarx/enarx/issues/193]
- Further trust models could be defined beyond the default one presented here.
